## Looking Forward

During the initial I noticed that Valve had assigned multiple roles to each of the game characters. The individual character attributes are calibrated to maximize the assigned roles and as such, we can somewhat predict players' actions based on the chosen characters' roles. For example, 4 out of the 5 most popular characters had a role of Carry and 3 out of 5 had the Disabler role as you can see below.


|Heroes|Roles|Popularity|
|---|---|---|
|Pudge|Disabler,Initiator, Durable, Nuker|1|
|Sniper|Carry,Nuker|2|
|Drow Ranger|Carry,Disabler,Pusher|3|
|Riki|Carry,Escape,Disabler|4|
|Phantom Assassin|Carry,Escape|5|


Unfortunately I did not have enough time to investigate the relationship between the roles and the character performance and selections and it is something I would like to continue exploring.

I'd like to thank [@odota](https://blog.opendota.com/2017/03/24/datadump2/) and [@waprin](https://github.com/waprin) for preparing the data and freely distributing for this analysis. Without their efforts, I wouldn't have been able to collect the data.
